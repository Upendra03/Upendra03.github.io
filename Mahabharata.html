        <p> 
            Started Reading Mahabharata, indian epic composed by Vyasa. <br/>
            The book I am reading is written by C. Rajagopalachari, last governor general of India.

            I have noted down main events from the story (chronologically).
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Bhagavan Vyasa, son of sage Parasaram wanted to write the Mahabaratha and he approached Brahma, the creator, to suggest him a scribe. Brahma suggests him to invoke lord Ganapati.<br>
                    Ganapati agress but with a condition that Vyasa should dictate continuously so that his pen should not stop while he is writing. <br/>
                    Vyasa agrees but with a counter condition that Ganapati must grasp the meaning before he writes it. Thus, allowing himself sometime to think while Ganapati tries to understand the complex stanzas.<br/><br/>

                    Although nobody knows what happened to the written version of Mahabharatha (I'm curious!!), Mahabaratha was handed down from generation to generation over memory. <br/>

                   As per this book, below is how its story spread everywhere and to everyone:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Vyasa taught that great epic to his son, sage Suka. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Suka taught it to the gandharvas, rakshasas and the yakshas. Narada told the story to devas.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Vaisampayana, chief disciple of Vyasa revealed the epic to humanity. During the sacrifice conducted by Janamejaya, the son of the king Parikshit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            later, Suta under the lead of Rishi Sanaka, narrated the story to assembly of sages in the forest of Naimisa
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ashta Vasus, attendant deities of Lord Indra and elemental gods as per indian mythology, where roaming with their wives and came upon the hermitage of sage Vasishtha. One of them saw Vasishtha's cow, Nandini, grazing and fell for its divine beauty. The wife of one of the Vasu named Prabhasa, demanded that she keep the cow for herself. It is said that drinking the milk of the cow, nandini, grants immortality and she wanted to gift it to her mortal friend. <br/>
                    Persuaded to steal by her, Prabhasa and rest of the Vasus stole the cow from the hermitage. Vasishtha after knowing what happened cursed the Vasus that they will be re-born as humans and serve their time as mortals. <br/>
                    Later, the Vasus approached Vasishtha and begged for his mercy. Seeing them acknowledge the mistake and honesty in their repentence, he agrees to reduce the quantum of punishment as he cannot make it ineffective. He declares, seven of the Vasus will die as soon as they are born and only Prabhasa, who towed away the cow from hermitage will live long and serve his punishment but will end as one of the greatest mortals ever to walk on earth. He is the grand old man of Mahabharatha, Bhishma.<br/>
                    Vasus then approach goddess Ganga and begged her to become their mother. She agrees to their prayers. Story of which unfolds next.
